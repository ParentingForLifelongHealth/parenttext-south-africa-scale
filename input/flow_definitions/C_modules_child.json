These could be about any part of their own body or that of the other sex - even private parts!\n\n💚 This teaches them it is safe to ask about the body, which means they will learn more and stay safer.\n\n👀 Teaching Your Child about their whole body, even when young, means they will know how to talk about it if anything happens that they feel is unsafe.",
