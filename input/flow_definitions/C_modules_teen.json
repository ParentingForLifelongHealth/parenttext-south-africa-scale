There are 6 basic emotions that each send us a very specific message:\n\n😃Happy: Keep doing things that make you feel good.\n\n😔Sad: Something important in your life needs attention.\n\n🔴Angry: Stand up for ourselves and set limits.\n\n😣Disgusted: Move away from what we don't like.\n\n👀Surprised: Stop and pay attention for a moment.\n\n🚩Afraid: Run away from danger.\n\n🎨 As teens, they learn to identify lots of other emotions, like feeling excited, frustrated, proud, lonely, peaceful, guilty, or confused.",

        "tips.message.4.text": "4️⃣ TALK\n\n😒 It is normal to struggle to talk about and express emotions and feelings. \n\n📝 Remember, it is also normal to experience feelings in different ways.\n\n⭐ When Your Teen is feeling an emotion, describe what you are observing in a calm way. \nFor example, \n\n“I notice you slammed the door, talk loudly, and your face looks a bit upset. Are you feeling angry because you can’t go out at night?”\n\nYou can also help Your Teen manage different emotions by encouraging them to share how they feel and supporting them.",
        "tips.message.5.text": " 5️⃣ SHARE\n\n😃 Share your own feelings with Your Teen. \n\nFor example, “I would feel the same way if I couldn’t go out when I wanted to”. \n\n 🎈This sets a good example and shows Your Teen that it's okay to share their own feelings.",
        "tips.message.6.text": "6️⃣ CARE\n\n🌷 Use actions and words to make Your Teen feel accepted and loved. \n\n⭐ Do some active exercise to shake out anger, give each other some space, or take some deep breaths to calm down.
